Port of Bubble Bobble for the Spectrum Next

Bubble Bobble for the Spectrum Next is a virtually arcade perfect port of the original arcade game with additional high score saving.

In order to run it requires the original arcade roms which are not supplied with this package - you must obtain them yourself.

The game requires patching to run. To do this you must take the following steps.

Place the unzipped ROM files in the same directory as the BUBNEXT.nex and BBNextPatch.exe

Run BBNextPatch by entering bbnextpatch <filename to patch> at the command line.  eg, to patch the default .nex in this archive type 'bbnextpatch bubnext.nex'

The process should take place automatically and produce an output .nex file prefixed with 'p_'.  This is now a standalone .nex file that can be copied to the Next (and renamed if wished).
